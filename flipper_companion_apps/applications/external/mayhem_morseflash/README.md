- Fast commands

## Connecting
| Flipper Zero pin | UART interface  |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| 13 TX            | RX              |

Info: If possible, do not power your devices from 3V3 (pin 9) Flipper Zero. It does not support hot plugging.

## Keyboard
UART_terminal uses its own special keyboard for work, which has all the symbols necessary for working in the console.

To accommodate more characters on a small display, some characters are called up by holding.
